# Economy Concepts

The economy is driven by supply and demand of individual actors. Instead of using a static equation to determine price, individual producers will alter selling prices based on recent buying trends while consumers constantly reevaluate their suppliers based on price and other factors.

## Trading

Prices in which entities sell goods are broadcasted to many star systems but due to the communications system of the game, price information has a lag before it reaches entities looking to buy goods. After a buyer sends an order to a seller, a transport service will deliver the goods from the seller to buyer.

There is also a delay from when a buyer sends an order and when it is received by the seller. Due to the delay, the price and stock levels at the seller will most likely change by the time the order is received. To protect the buyer, each order has three fields:
- **Max Price:** Order will be fulfilled only if the price is below this amount.
- **Max Amount:** If the price is acceptable, the buyer will buy as much as they can from the seller up to this amount.
- **Min Amount:** The seller must have more than this amount of a good for the order to go through.

## Sellers

Sellers control the selling price of goods and modify the price based on the change in rate of goods being purchased from the seller. Increases in the rate lead to higher prices while decreases lead to lower prices. When a good initially goes on market, the seller will start with the minimum price for a good and raise it as interest picks up.

## Buyers

Buyers buy goods from producers based on their own needs. A buyer will evaluate all known options for a specific good and purchase the "optimal" producer based on a number of factors.

Buyers decisions are influenced by the following factors:
- Profitability potential at current price
- Delivery time in relation to the time in which a buyers current stock will be depleted.
- Volatility of price and stock amounts for the seller
- Boycott orders from managing entities
