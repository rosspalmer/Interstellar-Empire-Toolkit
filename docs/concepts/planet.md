# Planet Concepts

Planets are the primary source of economic activity. Factories, mines, research facilities, and farms are generally located on planets.

Planets and the details of their surface have to be discovered by either scanning or buying exploration data. Multiple corporations can share a planet but only a single corporation can utilize a section of the planet map.
